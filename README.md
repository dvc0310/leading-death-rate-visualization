# Project Description

Our project utilizes the D3.js API to generate two primary visualizations: a line graph and a double bar graph.

Line Graph: This graph displays the death rates for both Howard County and Maryland over a certain time period. It also features a dropdown menu in the top left corner, allowing users to filter by specific causes of death.

Double Bar Graph: This visualization allows a direct comparison of death rates among various causes. It uses two colors to represent different areas; blue for the entirety of Maryland, and green for Howard County. This graph also includes a filtering option, with two dropdown menus representing the start and end years of a time period of interest.

The main goal of our project is to visually present and compare death rates from different causes and regions, providing an intuitive understanding of these complex datasets. The filtering options allow users to customize the visualizations according to their specific interests, facilitating a more personalized data exploration experience.
