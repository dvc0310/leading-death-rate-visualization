## Description

This project presents an interactive dashboard that visualizes death rates from various causes in Maryland and Howard County. 


## Prerequisites

- Any Internet Browser


## Usage

The dashboard allows users to filter data by time period and cause of death, providing a more personalized exploration of death rate data.

## API Used

This project uses D3.js version 7 API for creating visualizations. More about it can be found [here](https://d3js.org/). I've also used the Howard County Death Rate Dataset from  https://opendata.howardcountymd.gov/Health/Age-Adjusted-Death-Rates-for-Selected-Leading-Caus/j7s2-ynf8

## Visualizations

- **Line Graph**: Displays death rates over time for both Howard County and Maryland. Users can filter by cause of death.
- **Double Bar Graph**: Allows comparison of death rates by cause in Maryland and Howard County. Includes time period filter.
